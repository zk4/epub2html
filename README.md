# why
Read epub in PC is pain as hell. I have tried a lot tool for better view experience. No luck.
- Loading is slow because of the splitted file.
- No smooth scrolling.
- pdf generating is so ugly

BUT! we have chrome! Why dont we take advantage of it.
So, the basic idea is converting epub to a static html. That's it.

# Tested platform
- Mac
- Windows

# usage
``` bash
pip install epub2html
epub2html abc.epub

```
will open your converted epub html file in browser .


# open with double click like normal file (mac)

use automator, generate the app, create a `Run shell script` module
```
source ~/.bash_profile
epub2html "$1"
```
save it,
link the file with this app, You are good to go.



# todo
- follow https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html#sec-intro-epub-specs to read source.
- show/hide button does not locate in the middle of sidebar if menu too long
- repair ref link
- images and css location
